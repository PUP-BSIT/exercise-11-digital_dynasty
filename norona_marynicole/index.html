      <h2 class="opinion">MY OWN OPINION ON F2F OR ONLINE CLASS</h2>
      <p>
        In my own perspective, I think that we conducted a face-to-face class
        last April 20, 2024 because its more convenient, and for us to
        understand the lesson easily. Its more convenient for us since not all
        the students have materials in their homes that are needed in this
        subject such as the laptop, pc, and internet. Morover, its also an
        advantage for us to undestand the lesson carefully. Since our subject is
        coding and more on practical activities it will be easier for us to
        understand our professor and we will also have the materials that are
        needed in the class such as the pc and internet. Furthermore, in terms
        of having a Face-to-face or Online Class, I'm in favor of having a
        face-to-face class if the subject needed the practical activity or
        skills such as in laboratory activities. However, we should also
        consider the safety of everyone, specially in our current situation
        wherein we are currently facing a high-heat index.

      <h2 class="title">TESTIMONIALS</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          I couldn't ask for better group mate in coding. Her commitment to
          teamwork and willingness to lend a hand whenever needed have been
          instrumental in our success. -Bergado, Shamma
        </li>

        <li>
          I heartily endorse Mary Nicole She is an amazing developer and
          coworker because of her strong work ethic, collaborative spirit, and
          technical ability. -Reyes, John
        </li>

        <li>
          Coding alongside my group mates has been truly inspiring. Their
          passion for problem-solving and dedication to excellence make every
          session rewarding. -Reyes, Paul
        </li>

        <li>
          Mary, my classmate, demonstrates a good grasp of coding, though she's
          not an expert. I've seen her proficiency in various languages and her
          confidence in solving coding challenges. While she's not at a
          professional level yet, her dedication and competence shine in our
          class projects, making her a valuable team member. -Morcoso, Daisy
